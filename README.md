## Overview

This talk is a solid technical-ish overview of MCP and how you can use it from the perspective of a web developer.

Note: Rather than using a boring Google Slides or PowerPoint. I thought I'd try something new. What if we just made a presentation as a simple website with all the interactive capability of the web? So this is my attempt 

## Live Website

1. Clone the Repo and `cd` into it

1. Install Node dependencies via `npm install`

1. Run the server using `npm run dev`

1. Experience glory!
